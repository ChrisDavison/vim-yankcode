# Yank Code

A simple plugin that extracts a chunk of code with some text decoration.

If vim-fugitive is present, and the arg `with_git` is passed, uses vim-fugitive to decorate it with some commit information.

## Installation

I use `vim-plug`.

Simply add `Plug 'chrisdavison/vim-yankcode'` to your plugins.
